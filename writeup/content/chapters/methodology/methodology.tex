\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chp:methodology}

Now that the compositional models and the \gls{vcr} task were explored, this chapter will follow by going into detail about how the \gls{snmn} model was adapted to the \gls{vcr} dataset.
The details of how the dataset is prepared will be discussed first, going over any the extracting of image and text features, how these are processed, and any other data to be extracted.
The model adaptations performed will then follow, covering how the model will operate on the newly-generated data.
Finally, the experiments and how they were set up will be discussed.
