\label{chp:literature_review}

For this work, we will be exploring a subset of neural AI models know as compositional neural network models.
We will select a model of this type by exploring and discussing 3 such models, choosing one with which to proceed.
These models will be some of the more noteworthy models of this subset and will have defined 
Additional models of this type will be explored to see how they have been expanded and improved and how those improvements may be applied.
We will also explore the datasets used by the models down below, determining the characteristics of the datasets and their strengths.
