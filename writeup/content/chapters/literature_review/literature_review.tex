\chapter{Literature review}
\label{chp:literature_review}

For this work, we will be exploring a subset of neural AI models know as compositional neural network models.
We will select model of this type by exploring and discussing 3 such models, choosing one with which to proceed.
We will also explore the datasets used by the models down below, determining the characteristics of the datasets and their strengths.
