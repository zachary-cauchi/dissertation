\label{chp:literature_review}

For this work, we will be exploring a subset of neural AI models know as compositional neural network models.
We will select a model of this type by exploring and discussing three such models, choosing one with which to proceed.
These models, while not the state-of-the-art as of the time of planning this work, will be some of the more noteworthy models of this subset and will have had a notable influence on successive models.
Additional models of this type will also be explored to see how they have been expanded and improved upon.
We will also explore the datasets used by the models down below, determining the characteristics of the datasets, their strengths, and any observed drawbacks.
