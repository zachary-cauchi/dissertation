\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my thanks to Professor Adrian Muscat for supervising me during this work, his feedback and guidance has been instrumental in this work and I wouldn't have achieved this without him.
I would also like to thank my friends and family for supporting me throughout this endeavour, especially during those times where my confidence wavered.
