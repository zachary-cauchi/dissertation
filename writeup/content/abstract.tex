In the field of \gls{ai} vision-language tasks, \gls{vcr} stands out as an interesting case of requiring an \gls{ai} model to not only predict correct answers, but explain why those answers were chosen.
The \gls{snmn} model also stands out as a model which tries to predict answers with explainable reasoning by using a memory stack to produce the reasoning steps taken.
This study adapts the \gls{snmn} model to predict answers and rationales to \gls{vcr} tasks, attempting to obtain viable accuracy in the process.
The results do not reveal state-of-the-art accuracy and also showed signs of overfitting, but do suggest avenues for future work that may yet improve the model.
