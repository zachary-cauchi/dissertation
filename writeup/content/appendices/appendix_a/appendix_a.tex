A script to generate the final word embeddings for the \gls{imdb} files is then used to perform the below steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate a co-occurrence matrix on the \gls{corpus} and vocabulary files that were previously compiled.
    \item Convert the co-occurrence matrix to a final 300-dimensional embeddings file.
    \item Convert the embeddings into a binary file for loading and parsing by the model at startup.
\end{itemize}
